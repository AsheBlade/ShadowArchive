对报税一窍不通. 这里总结一下边边角角搜集的笔记

## W4

W4: All employees on your payroll need to complete a W-4 within their first month on the job.

The form indicates how much should be withheld from each employee’s paycheck and submitted to the IRS. The amount would depend on factors such as the employee’s marital status, number of dependents and personal withholding preference.

## W2 

W2:  Employers must submit a W-2 for each employee to the IRS at the end of every year. Employers must also provide employees with a copy of their W-2 by Jan. 31.

This year-end form reports an individual employee’s earnings, including gross pay, tips and bonuses, as well as their federal tax contributions, encompassing Social Security and Medicare taxes. Any additional withholdings, such as contributions to retirement plans, would also appear on the W-2.

**W2 can be a crucial evidence for your past working experience.**


## Difference between W4 & W2

So basically you don't need to worry about W2. **W2 is filled by employers and reported to the IRS by the employers which is not your business.**

Also, you don't need to worry too much about W4 either, since it is done within your first month on the job. 
For example, I remember I went to mado and ask for help for the w4. 

**W2 can be a crucial evidence for your past working experience.**

## 报税 Tax return

每年的报税, 也就是tax return, 要根据需要退一点钱或者加一点. 

通常的程序: 

1. 找第三方帮你根据w2填表
2. 自己找信封把表格寄给IRS

需要填的表: 

1. 1040NR(NR=non-residence, 专门给外国人)  **Attach W2 copy B**
2. 8843和上面的1040NR装订在一起  (for all individuals in F, J, M, and Q immigration)   **Attach W2 copy**
3. 另外每个州有自己单独的一份表格. 

**这些表格都应该是第三方帮你处理, 自己不需要操心**, 我目前用的是cwru 提供的[springtax](https://www.sprintax.com/uni-lp.html?utm_ref=case-western-reserve-uni&utm_content=prmc), 

## Deadline
 
 April 15th
 
## 邮寄

我搜了一会儿, 都没有搜到可以网络给IRS交表格的办法. 不管了, 直接邮寄吧. 

不要去亚马逊买信封邮票, 太贵.  也不要去USPS官网买stamped envelope, 太小, 装不下. 最正确的方式是去周围的超市买个大信封, 去USPS官网买邮票.
