## Overview

If you ask me who is my favourite actress I would think for a while and tell you I'm not sure and give you a list of names. But if you ask me who is my favourite Asian-American actress, I will tell you the answer right away: it is Maggie Q. 

For years between 2010-2014, Maggie Q is one of my favourite actresses. I start loving her after watching "Die Hard 4" and "Mission Impossible 4".  I remember in 2012, I talked to the unnamed person about Nikita, and he/she was like yeahhhhhh.

For years, I was always trying to eat like a vegan or at least trying to experience the vegan diet. Actually, if in China I am kinda of a vegan already. My ex-grilfriends always have a hard time to go out for dinner with me because there are lots of stuff I don't eat. I don't eat pork, organs and prefer not to eat too much beef or chicken.  In fact, I'm currently be eating as fish diet. In China, people call it "鱼素", which means I rarely eat any meat other than fish and seafood. It's not like I am controlling myself not to eat any beef or chicken, just because I always prefer eating fish. 

So, it seems that Maggie Q has been a pure vegan for 20 years and published lots of articles regarding to vegan diet. I say, why not? I would like to take a good look into her diet pattern. 

## Don't Judge

> “I don’t [call myself vegan], because it has become a weird, negative term and people feel very judged by it,” she told The Beet. “So I like plant-based better because it’s friendlier: It’s inclusive. You can’t judge people. They have to be where they’re at, and you have to accept them for where they are.”

Certainly my favourite quote from her.  **People have to be where they are at, don't judge.**

## Maggie's Breakfast

>Breakfast before and afters! In a blender: Coconut Meat, Acai, Aloe, blackberries, blueberries, cherries, goji berries, coconut oil, fresh ginger, fresh turmeric, fennel, Health Force Naturals brand- greener grasses and earth powder, fresh homemade almond milk!

Blend together and top with your favorite dried granola, goji berries and coconut! #BeQind and eat nutrient packed foods in the morning! I promise it makes a difference for you, the animals, and the environment!
