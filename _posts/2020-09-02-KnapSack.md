## Overview

Today I would like to spend some time to talk about KnapSack problem, as it is a perfect problem to practice greedy algorithm and dynamic programming. 

As we know, there are two kinds of knapSack problem: 

1. Fractional Knapsack Problem
2. non-Fractional Knapsack Problem

The Fractional Knapsack Problem is a very easy greedy algorithm example, while the non-fractional one is a very hard problem that **cannot** be solved by Greedy algorithm.  Even using dynamic programming, I would say it is a hard. 

### Fractional Knapsack Problem

Fractional knapsack problem allows us to take fractional weight from the item. 

**其实Greedy没什么可以学的必要**, 简单的greedy很容易想出来, 难的greedy也想不出来, 而且不安全. 这里仅以这一道greedy做个例子, 以便于以后忘了greedy是啥的时候回来看看. 

For example: 

> We have 3 items, A, B, C.  A{60, 10}, B{100, 20}, C{120,30} with the first number as weight, second as value.  
> For a knapsack of capacity 50, we need to maximize the value we can carry. 

Since in fractional we can take only a fraction of item, we can easily solve this by using greedy algorithm. 
We use value/weight to calculate the cost for each item Put the highest cost item in the knapsack first, the second and so on.  It is a simple and straightforward apporach. The time complexity pretty much depends on the sorting, with merge sort we will get time complexity of `O(nlogn)`. 



**Code**

```java

public class KnapSack {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] weights = {10, 40, 20, 30};
        int[] values = {60, 40, 100, 120};
        int capacity = 50;

        double maxValue = getMaxValue(weights, values, capacity);
        System.out.println("Maximum value we can obtain = " +
                maxValue);

    }

    // function to get maximum value
    private static double getMaxValue(int[] weights,
                                      int[] values, int capacity) {

        double totalValue = 0d;

        // init an itemList to contain all the elements.
        Item[] itemList = new Item[weights.length];

        for(int i = 0; i < weights.length; i++)
        {
            itemList[i] = new Item(weights[i], values[i], i);
        }

        selectionSort(itemList, itemList.length);

        for (int i=0; i < itemList.length; i++)
        {
            if (capacity - itemList[i].weight >=0 )
            {
                totalValue = totalValue + itemList[i].value;
                capacity = capacity - (int)itemList[i].weight;
            }
            else
            {
                totalValue = totalValue + itemList[i].cost * capacity;
                break;
            }
        }
        // We need to sort this itemList by each item's cost.
        // For here, I will just use selection sort, because it's easy to use.
        // If we want to improve time complexity, we can always use other faster sortings.

        return totalValue;
    }

    public static class Item
    {
        double cost, weight, value, index;

        public Item(int weight, int value, int index)
        {
            this.weight = weight;
            this.value = value;
            this.index = index;
            this.cost = this.value/this.weight;
        }
    }

    private static void selectionSort(Item arr[], int n)
    {
        int maxIndex;

        // One by one move boundary of unsorted subarray
        for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++)
        {
            // Find the minimum element in unsorted array
            maxIndex = i;
            for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++)
                if (arr[j].cost > arr[maxIndex].cost)
                    maxIndex = j;

            // Swap the found minimum element with the first
            // element
            Item temp = arr[maxIndex];
            arr[maxIndex] = arr[i];
            arr[i] = temp;
        }
    }


}
```

### Non-Fractional Knapsack Problem

Non-Fractional knapsack problem cannot be solved by greedy method, we have to use dynamic programming. 

关于 Non-Fractional 移步去看dynamic programming, 里面有写.  Greedy不重要, 可以不掌握. 更多关于Greedy可以看这个[文档](../uploads/files/Unit 3 - Discussion Board.pdf), 里面有更多总结和例子.
