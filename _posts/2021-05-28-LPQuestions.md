## When have you handled huge pressure in a work-related situation?

In my previous job, a work colleague left unexpectedly. He had been responsible for a project that had to be delivered within a very tight deadline. 

My supervisor asked the workforce for a volunteer to take on the project, and I decided to step up and take responsibility. To be honest, I prefer to work under pressure and I saw this as an opportunity to help out the company in their hour of need. 

I studied the brief carefully and then created a plan of action of getting the project delivered on budget and also on time. It was tough going, but I put in the extra hours' work needed and I am pleased to say I managed to get the project finished on time and to specification. My supervisor was thrill;ed with my work ethic and effort, and he thanked me for my commitment and dedication to delivering this important project. 


## Can you give an example of how you dealt with conflict in the workplace? 

In my previous job , there was one particular work colleague who seemed to dislike me. During meetings he would ignore my contributions and he made a number of unacceptable comments in the canteen on more than one occasion. 

I decided to tackle the situation in a calm manner. However, before I approached him to discuss the situation, I needed to decide what it was I wanted to achieve from the discussion. 

I undersatnd we cannot always get on with everyone in a workplace environment, but the problem with this type of situation is it can be detrimental to the organisation as a whole. On that basis, I wanted to first of all try and see if there was anything I was doing that irritated him, before trying to reach a constructive solution to the problem. 

Once I had determined my goal, I approached him while he was on his own and asked him if we could have a private discussion away from other office workers.

We sat down in a room away from everyone else and explained my concerns with regards to how I felt he was treating me. I also aksed him if there was anything I was doing that irritated him. His initial reaction was extremely defensive, but I maintained my position and repaeated my feellings with regards to how he was treating me in a calm and non-confrontational manner.
