## Overview
This page is about how to embed video and audios into Jekyll.   
Everything on this page is from nathancy's work from [here](https://github.com/nathancy/jekyll-embed-video#embed-google-drive)  
Please note that we should try to avoid using local or Youtube files as much as possible. Do use Google Drive!

## Youtube
{% include youtubePlayer.html id=page.youtubeId %}

## Google Drive Video
{% include googleDrivePlayer.html id=page.driveId %}

## Google Drive Mp3
