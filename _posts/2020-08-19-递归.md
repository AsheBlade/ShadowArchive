## Overview

递归这一块始终是我不善于的一个难点. 这一部分需要多刷和多练, 并且死记硬背一些定式.  
在此收录一些典型题和难题.

## Number of Islands LC_200
**Description**

Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

Example 1:  
> Input: grid = [  
>   ["1","1","1","1","0"],  
>   ["1","1","0","1","0"],  
>   ["1","1","0","0","0"],  
>   ["0","0","0","0","0"]  
> ]  
> Output: 1  

Example 2:  
> Input: grid = [  
>   ["1","1","0","0","0"],  
>   ["1","1","0","0","0"],  
>   ["0","0","1","0","0"],  
>   ["0","0","0","1","1"]  
> ]  
> Output: 3

**Solution**
```java
public class Solution {
    
    char[][] island;
    
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        int count = 0;
        
        this.island = grid;
        for(int i = 0; i < island .length; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < island [i].length; j++){
                /*find a cell belong to an island, then disappear the whole 
                  island and increase count*/
                if(island [i][j] == '1'){
                    disappear(i,j);
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    //Use for disapearing an island
    public void disappear(int i, int j){
        //array edge detect
        if(i < 0 || i >= island .length){
            return;
        }
        if(j < 0 || j >= island [i].length){
            return;
        }
        //island edge detect
        if(island [i][j] == '0'){
            return;
        }
        
        //disapear this cell
        island [i][j] = '0';
        //disapear other cell in the same island
        disappear(i + 1, j);
        disappear(i - 1, j);
        disappear(i, j + 1);
        disappear(i, j - 1);
    }
}
```
