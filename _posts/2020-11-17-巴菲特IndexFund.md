## Overview

Over years, Mr.Buffet has recommended the S&P 500 fund many times for non-professional investors.  For here, I collected some of the most famous quotes from him related to this topic. 

## The famous Long Bet 2008

In the bet, Warren Buffett predicted that **“Over a ten-year period commencing on January 1, 2008, and ending on December 31, 02017, the S&P 500 will outperform a portfolio of funds of hedge funds, when performance is measured on a basis net of fees, costs and expenses.”**

**Warren Buffett invested in the Vanguard index fund. Protégé picked five hedge fund of funds** (whose names have never been publicly disclosed—although Buffett does see their annual audits).

While Protégé’s position pulled ahead in the early years of the bet, which occurred during the global financial collapse, Buffett’s position more than made up for it, taking the lead for the first time in the bet’s fifth year. Over the decade-long bet, the index fund returned 7.1% compounded annually. Protégé funds returned an average of only 2.2% net of all fees. Buffett’s point, which was well-illustrated, is that when looking at returns, fees are often ignored or obscured. And when that money is not re-invested each year with the principal, it can almost never overtake an index fund if you take the long view.

## Advice to common Investors 2008

**“If you were 30 years old and had no dependents but a full-time job that precluded full-time investing, how would you invest your first million dollars, assuming that you can cover 18 months of expenses with other savings? Thank you in advance for being as specific as possible with asset classes and allocation percentage.”**

Buffett let out a small laugh and began. “I’d put it all in a low-cost index fund that tracks the S&P 500 and get back to work…”

**Most investors have not made the study of business prospects a priority in their lives. If wise, they will conclude that they do not know enough about specific businesses to predict their future earning power.** I have good news for the non – professionals: The typical investor doesn’t need this skill. In aggregate, American business has done wonderfully over time and will continue to do so (though, most assuredly, in unpredictable fits and starts).

"The 21st century will witness further gains, almost certain to be substantial. The goal of the non-professional should not be to pick winners — neither he nor his 'helpers' can do that — but should rather be to own a cross-section of businesses that in aggregate are bound to do well. A low-cost S&P 500 index  fund will achieve this goal." (2013)


## CNBC Interview 2019

Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett said Monday that given a choice between stocks and bonds over the next 10 years, he’d put his money in equities.

**“If I had a choice today for a 10-year purchase of a 10-year bond at whatever it is ... or buying the S&P 500 and holding it for 10 years, I’d buy the S&P in a second,”** the 88-year-old Buffett said told CNBC. “Interest rates govern everything, and if there were a way to short 30-year bonds and own the S&P for 30 years, I would give you enormous odds that the S&P is going to beat 30-year bonds.”

## In Berkshire meeting 2020

Buffett believes average investors should buy the broad market for the long term instead of following stock-picking advice of others.

**“In my view, for most people, the best thing is to do is owning the S&P 500 index fund,” Buffett said. “There are huge amounts of money people pay for advice they really don’t need.”**

**“If you bet on America and sustain that position for decades, you’d do far better than buying Treasury securities, or far better than following people who tell you”** what to invest, he added.

He said people should never borrow money to participate in the market, especially now given the uncertainty around the pandemic.

“When something like the current pandemic happens, it’s hard to factor that in. That’s why you never want to use borrowed money, at least in my view, into investments,” Buffett said.
