Welcome to Virtual Advising, Yiming!  An ISS advisor will be with you soon. The advisor may be assisting multiple students, so we appreciate your patience!

hi
11:46
Hi, this is Tanya. How can I help you today?
11:47
so previously I applied a STEM OPT and got rejected due to my outdated i765 and now I applied a new graduate school and got a new i20.
I checked my sevis portal. it still shows my previous applied stem OPT and I"m not able to update it.  My question is, should I update my SEIVS portal accordingly?
11:48
what do you need to be updated?
11:48
I have an active stem OPT in my sevis portal which is not true.
I'm now a graudate student and not longer working in there.
11:51
Can you please email international@case.edu with the details of this situation and copy of your I-765 rejection letter from USCIS?
We will have to submit a correction request to SEVIS
11:52
sure. I will send this to Angela Beca. She has been helping me and aware of my situation.
Another question.
11:53
My OPT ended on 07/19. now my new i20 starts 08/15.  I should be able to stay in US leaglly. Am I correct?
11:53
did you work on OPT?
11:54
Yes I did work on my  post completion OPT for a year from 09/2019 to 07/2020
11:58
Yes, you are allowed to remain in the US during that break in between OPT and the start of your new program
11:59
Thank you. My Visa expires on 08/2021. I would like to get a new Visa before it expires. Are you aware of when I can apply a new Visa?  I didn't get any info from US embassy.
12:00
Unfortunately the only person who can answer how early you can apply to renew your visa (versus applying to replace a lost or stolen visa) would be the consulate you would be going to to renew your visa
12:01
Ideally there should be some information on their website as to when you can begin that process
12:01
okok. But if my application got rejected. I will still be able to use my old Visa? Am I correct?
12:01
(I would assume it would have to be much closer to the expiration date next August)
12:02
If my application for a new Visa got rejected and my old Visa were not expired, will I be able to still use my old Visa?
12:05
Traditionally once a visa is renewed the original visa page is marked "CWOP" (Cancelled Without Prejudice) in order to make sure all US government agencies who need to check your visa page can clearly determine which page is the valid one
12:07
One last question, my current master program ends in 02/2022. If I were to apply a new Visa in 07/2021 and my current Visa expires in 08/2021, will they give me a new Visa.  I'm thinking they might just say I can just go back before August and finish my program since my program ends soon and I already holds a visa
12:09
Ideally you would know this before you can actually make an appointment with the US Embassy to renew your visa since you would have to submit a new DS-160 application at that time
12:10
As they would either a) proceed to schedule an appointment to renew your visa or b) message you that it's too early to do so
(At which time you'd continue to use your current visa page to return to the US)
Remember that you're legally allowed to remain in the US after your US visa page has expired so long as you continue to maintain your visa status properly
12:11
One last question, Am I allowed to go to Canada or Mexico to get a Visa? I'm Chinese, do I have to go back to China.
12:11
So, if you enter the US anytime between now and 8/2021 and then cannot travel again before your program ends you'd be fine
12:12
yeah. I'm aware of that, but I plan to get another OPT after I graduate.  I assume it is always easier more flexible to get a Visa when I'm a student?  I hate to apply for a Visa when I"m in OPT. :)
12:12
We do not recommend that students go to the US Consulates in Canada or Mexico to renew their visas unless the are a) those nationalities or b) have other business which requires them to go to those countries and, therefore, would need to go to the consulates in those countries instead of going home
12:15
Theoretically yes, it would be simpler to renew your visa page while you're still pursuing your degree but, unless you intend to be actively travelling in and out of the US after your visa page expires and/or graduation it's not mandatory to do so
12:16
Yes, I understand. I just feel better to have a Visa so I can leave and come back US whenever I want.
Thank you so much for all these advices, I really appreciate your help.  Hope you have a nice day.
12:18
I understand!
Hopefully we answered all your questions?
12:19
Yes you did .  Thanks. I will email Angela Beca about my SEVIS portal issue.
12:19
Great.
12:20
Feel free to close the chat whenever you're ready
Have a good and safe afternoon!
