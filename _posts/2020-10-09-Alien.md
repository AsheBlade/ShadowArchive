Since about 2016, I always wanted to keepr record on things. Preserve and download, never trust Internet, because Internet does not hold information forever. 

Alien movies has always been one of my favourite movie series. Since I was not borned that early, I never have the chance to enjoy the orignal series. Even though I did download the first alien movie about one year ago, I still could not enjoy it due to my age. 

Here, I would like to preserve on these alien videos that are related to promethus and covenant. Those videos are not included in the movie, so I put them here in case I could not find them one day. 

## Prometheus - The Engineer Speaks

## Covenant _ Meet Walter

{% include googleDrivePlayer.html id=page.driveId2 %}

## Covenant _ Prologue_ Last Supper 

{% include googleDrivePlayer.html id=page.driveId3 %}


## Covenant _ Prologue_ The Crossing

{% include googleDrivePlayer.html id=page.driveId4 %}

## David, A.I  - Prometheus & Covenant

This is a fan made video, I don't quite agree with the direction of this video (it is about AI). But it is still a very good fan made video.
