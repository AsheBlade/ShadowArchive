## Official Plugin

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/uploads/album" %}

Here, we are using the plugin from the Jekyll official website in [here](https://jekyllcodex.org/without-plugin/image-gallery/#). 

As you can see, it's pretty raw. 

## A better one from Livier Pieters

This is the best one I have and simplest one to build so far.  Trust me, I have been searching for this for hours.    **And I have successfully build it locally.**

Here is the [guide](https://olivierpieters.be/blog/2016/02/26/creating-a-jekyll-image-gallery)

I have starred the github page on 08-27-2020. 

However, there is still lots of work to be done if I want to integrate his code into mine.  Lots of work..
