Mac上配置Path路径挺费事儿的. 这次总结一个快捷有效的办法. 

Rather than editing $HOME/.bashrc like the flutter shows, you can start doing this by directly editing the paths file in etc.  

Like me, I have trouble locating the bashrc file.  

There is a paths file in etc.  

```
cd /etc
sudo vim paths
enter password
edit the paths file, add the new path into that file
```

You will have to close and restart terminal to see this work.  

echo $PATH to check your paths file and see if it worked.  

You probably needs to restart vs code or any IDE.
