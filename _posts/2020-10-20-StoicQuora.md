非常喜欢的一篇Quora文章. 感觉有点像写手编的. 不过无伤大雅, 因为道理是可以学的.

We hired a talented young man out of college.

He was paid well for a college student but had zero experience in the industry. We knew it would take time to train him on our dime. We also knew that he would make plenty of mistakes.

We were wrong.

He blew through his training and was performing at the level of our veterans within months. Additionally, he was an incredible team player and was regularly showing up early and staying late, taking on additional responsibilities. Within six months, he was the best performer in the office which was highly unusual for an entry-level hire.

Because of his incredible capacity to learn and willingness to work hard, he was performing like someone who had been in the industry for ten years.

In essence, he forced us to consider what a competitor would pay for him if they knew what he was capable of. That math was elementary. He started at a salary of $45,000 and the industry paid $40,000 to $80,000 for someone at his similar position.

In essence, he was performing like an $80,000 employee with the experience of someone making $40,000.

We wanted to get ahead of the situation and show him how much we appreciated him. Working for a large company, this was easier said than done. The layers of bureaucracy always bog this process down.

We gave him an unexpected $5,000 raise in his 7th month with the company and thanked him for a sensational start to his career. This bump was in addition to the merit raise he would receive in several months, with the rest of his peers. We gave him the news and then waited for the gushing appreciation.

He was stoic.


He thanked us politely, shook our hand and never changed his facial expression during the conversation. He told us he had a big deadline he was working on and asked to be excused. It was like Tom Dwan quietly saying “check” on a $100,000 pot.

We were rattled.

“What the hell was that all about?”

“I never got a $5,000 raise after six months with a company!”

And then the question we were all worried about:

“Do you think he has an offer from another company?”

I brought him back by my office the next day individually. He could be unhappy with any number of things, including his direct managers and I wanted him to feel comfortable sharing.

I asked him what he thought about the raise after giving him some background on how organizations rarely hand out double-digit raises so quickly. He reiterated politely that he appreciated the gesture.

I asked him if he liked working for our company. Again, he politely told me, yes but he certainly wasn’t gushing.

Finally, I came out with it and told him why I was concerned. We rarely did something like this, but when we have, I hadn’t seen someone so unaffected afterward. He finally gave me what I was looking for:

“I know what I am worth. I know what value I bring to this office and appreciate that you recognized it in me. But, we both know that you are getting a great deal with what you are paying me.”

He said this in such an objective fashion that I couldn’t be offended. It was like talking to Don Corleone who wanted me to know that “this is business, nothing personal.”

I asked him if he thought we were paying him unfairly and his answer was great again.

“I can’t determine fair, but I do know what I could make doing the same job at another company. I like it here. It is just hard for me to tell you that I am excited about what I am paid.”

The lesson in this example is that he didn’t show us any of his cards and forced us to think. He was polite and all business. He understood something that too many people working for companies don’t think through.

Your manager does not give you a raise out of the goodness of her heart.

Even if you work for a charity, budgets are essential for companies to stay in business. Spend too much on payroll and your company will have to save in other areas like office location, marketing, customer service, etc. Cut too much in any one area, and customers quit buying from you. If enough quit buying, your company will go bankrupt.

Managers give you a raise because they are afraid they might lose you to a competitor. Period.

It is a business decision every time. How much would it cost to replace your production and what disruption would that bring to the office?

Now, does your manager want you to be happy and feel like you can afford to live comfortably in that market? So long as you are a solid performer. I wanted to work with people who could focus on their work, not the fairness of what they were paid in relationship to the market.

In the example above, we would need to pay $80,000 to get someone who produced at his level. He literally did the work of two people. Even then, they probably wouldn't fit our culture as well nor work as hard. That $5,000 raise was nothing compared to the returns we were getting.

I never gushed when I received a pay raise. I earned every single one of them and deserved the additional pay. Like my young superstar, I shook my manager’s hand, thanked them politely and got back to work. No gushing, no emotions and I certainly wasn’t letting you think that I felt it was generous.

I wanted you to think about my reaction, just as we got together to figure out the young star’s response to his $5,000 raise. I was always polite, but I wanted each manager to know that I expected at least this much and probably more.

The young man in my story made out well. Three months later, we promoted him into a role with a much higher salary range. He was starting at the bottom of that range, but the upside was $150,000. Again, we did this because it made good business sense.

Did he jump out of his chair and hug me, then ask if he could call his mother?

Of course not.

Did he kill it in that role and earn every penny?

Yep.
