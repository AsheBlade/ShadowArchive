<p>Rather than editing $HOME/.bashrc like the flutter shows, you can start doing this by directly editing the paths file in etc.</p>

<p>Like me, I have trouble locating the bashrc file.</p>

<p>There is a paths file in etc.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd /etc
sudo vim paths
enter password
edit the paths file, add the new path into that file
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You will have to close and restart terminal to see this work.</p>

<p>echo $PATH to check your paths file and see if it worked.</p>

<p>You probably needs to restart vs code or any IDE.</p>
